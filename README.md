## 🩺 Problem Statement
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide.  
Early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes.

**Objective:**  
To build a machine learning system that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient health metrics, enabling **early intervention and data-driven decision-making**.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- **Algorithm:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Why KNN?**
  - Multiple machine learning algorithms were evaluated, including **Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree**
  - After comparative testing and validation, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** achieved the **highest accuracy** on the dataset
  - Performs exceptionally well with normalized numerical medical data
  - Simple, robust, and well-suited for healthcare risk prediction tasks


### Workflow:
1. Data Collection  
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
3. Feature Scaling  
4. Model Training & Validation  
5. Prediction via Web Interface
